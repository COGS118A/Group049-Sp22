    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "This project aims to create a model to recognize German traffic signs when given traffic signs pictures. The project data consists of images for both training and testing and class labels for each photo. Class labels are used for recognizing the traffic signs; they are descriptions of the traffic signs such as \"No entry\" or \"Turn left ahead.\"   We will shuffle the training data first and then one-hot encoding the labels. After that, we will use the training data and encoded labels to train multiple machine learning models and pick the one with the highest accuracy. We will measure the performance of the models using accuracy, which is calculated by the number of correct predictions / total number of data. Finally, we will run the best performance model on different datasets to report its performance under various conditions. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic sign recognition has become a more popular topic in the past decade. With the enhancement of advanced technology, people have put eyes on automated vehicles. In order for the vehicles to be automated, the vehicle itself has to understand all the signs and the road traffic in real time. Thus the vehicle itself can act as a driver and does not require any input or interference by human. Therefore, for the safety of the passengers, traffic sign recognition is significantly important for autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic signs recognition needs two parts: localization and recognition. Localization is for detecting and localizing where a traffic sign is in the image, and recognition is for identifying the sign. Also, because many images are low contrast and hard to distinguish, we can use “an algorithm called Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)” to increase the contrast. Thus, we can make images easier for computer to recognize<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote).\n",
    "\n",
    "Research in the past has conducted on the traffic sign recognition and one difficulty that always arise is the lighting conditions in the outdoor environments<a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote). This study considers the problem of lighting conditions and try to resolve it with a computer algorithm. The study recognizes that lighting conditions are changeable and not controllable, thus it is not possible to generate a complete model of all possibilities of the sign’s appearance<a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote). The study proposed an algorithm that takes only the Hue and Saturation components in order to avoid lighting condition, this way, the recognition will be less affected by the lighting conditions<a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another paper utilizes the live speed of cars to help improve the recognition algorithm <a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#admonishnote). By doing this, they can speed up the algorithm while remain the high accuracy."

The process to solving the problem will involve testing and training sets from a centralized dataset using a CNN or PCA approach to classification. The accuracy with which the model can classify each image/sign would be a quantifiable measure of how successful the model is. The goal is to reach a 98% accuracy in prediction, as that is the benchmark for the dataset that we will be using. \n"

    "Our proposed solution is to use a CNN to classify the images in the dataset. The images themselves would need to be converted to a format such that the image data can be fit into numpy arrays. Additionally, the labels of the dataset would need to be one-hot encoded so that calculations and predictions can be made. The model itself would be made using libraries such as tensorflow or keras, and the image data would need to be shuffled for the models to be trained properly. A portion of the dataset would be used as training data while the other will be used as testing/validation data. The solution will be tested by comparing the predicted ID of an image with the image’s actual class ID to calculate the accuracy of the model.
